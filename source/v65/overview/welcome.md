This release is reserved strictly for HCL's Cloud Hosting Partners.

This space is for you to reference HCL Connections 6.5 CR1a Muti- Tenant Product Documentation and collaborate with your fellow hosting partners, Connections engineers, and product management.

# Understanding HCL Connections Multi-Tenant

As an MST for Connections Multi-tenant, your responsibilities still include any that you would have on-premises, for example, Connections does not do disk backups, DB backups and so on. Connections MT expects an existing LDAP schema which HCL provides and will then only read from LDAP. IBM Security Directory Server is supported.
