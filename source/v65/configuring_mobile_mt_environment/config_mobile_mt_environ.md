# Configuring Mobile for the Multi-Tenant environment
The Connections mobile app for iOS and Android fully supports the Connections MT environment. User’s must be using version 6.5.4 or later, as these versions contain critical fixes for multi-tenant. By default, the server’s mobile- config.xml has been provisioned to require a minimum version of 6.5.4, so user’s with previous app versions will receive an error asking them to upgrade to the latest version before they can connect to the server.

The Connections Mobile app for iOS is available to any user from the Apple App Store and Connections Mobile app for Android is available from Google Play.
