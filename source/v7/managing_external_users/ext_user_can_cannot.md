# What external users can and can't do

As a general rule, external users in the Multi-Tenant environment can participate fully in things they are directly involved with, such as a file they've created or that someone has shared with them. The experience is similar, but not identical, to that in Connections on-premises.

Provisioning external users is a separate step that should be performed after the data migration has been completed on the production server. For general description where this step fits in the overall process of data migration, please refer to Database migration overview.

## External user experience – what they CAN do

- Perform the following:

    - Standalone Files that they uploaded, or that were shared with them
