# Configuring the Connections community app for Microsoft Sharepoint

Once the configuring tasks are complete, Community owners can choose to add the app to their community for members to be able to view, edit, and share documents from a SharePoint server. For the user help, see [Adding the SharePoint app to a community](https://help.hcltechsw.com/connections/v7/user/communities/t_com_add_sharepoint_widget.html).

**Note:** The SharePoint app is installed with the rest of Connections during installation.
