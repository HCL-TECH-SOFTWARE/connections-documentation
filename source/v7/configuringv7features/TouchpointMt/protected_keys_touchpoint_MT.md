# Protected keys
During Config inheritance a few config keys are protected and cannot be set by the Org
Admin (Step 3). This feature is here to make Touchpoint MT work properly and eliminate
chances to misconfigure Touchpoint MT for one or more orgs.
The following keys are protected:
- connectionsApiUri
- contentDirectory
- homepageCtxRoot
- opensocialCtxRoot
- orientMe.enabled
- orientMe.socialCtxRoot
- orientMe.itmCtxRoot
- profilesCtxRoot
- steps.welcome.templateFile
