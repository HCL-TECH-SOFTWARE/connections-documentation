# Enhancement of Supported Languages in HCL Connections 7.0 Cumulative Fix (CFix.70.2110)

The following eleven languages are again supported with the release of CFix.70.2110.

- Bulgarian
- Croatian
- Danish
- Hungarian
- Norwegian
- Portuguese (Portugal)
- Romanian
- Slovak
- Slovenian
- Swedish
- Turkish

These languages were originally excluded from support with the initial release of HCL Connections 7.0 MT, but are made available with this CFix.

## Limitations
- These restored languages do not apply to all features within the HCL Connections Component Pack. 
- End user help translations with the new languages will be made available online at the [HCL Help Center](https://help.hcltechsw.com/connections/v7/user/welcome/welcome_end_user.html) only and are in the process of being completed.  
- Due to limited testing on this effort there may be some minor issues. Any issues identified will be addressed in V8.
